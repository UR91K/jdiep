## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Entity Component System (ECS)

The game uses a custom ECS architecture for better performance and maintainability:

- **Entities**: Basic containers with unique IDs
- **Components**: Pure data containers (e.g., Position, Movement, Render)
- **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on entities with specific components

### Key Systems

- **RenderSystem**: Handles all rendering operations
- **MovementSystem**: Processes entity movement
- **NetworkSystem**: Manages multiplayer synchronization with client-side prediction
- **InputSystem**: Processes user input
- **CameraSystem**: Handles game view and viewport
- **PhysicsSystem**: Manages rigid body physics and collision detection
- **AISystem**: Controls bot behavior and boid simulation
- **AudioSystem**: Handles sound synthesis and playback

## Development

The project follows these key principles:

- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Multiplayer-first design
- Incremental feature implementation
