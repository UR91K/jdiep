## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Libraries

- **Ashley ECS**: Core entity component system
- **LWJGL**: OpenGL rendering and GLFW input
- **JBox2D**: Physics simulation
- **Netty**: Networking layer
- **OpenAL**: Audio system
- **imGUI**: Debug interface
- **tinylog**: Logging system

### Module Organization

```
Core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Engine (Ashley ECS + basic systems)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Physics (JBox2D wrapper)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rendering (LWJGL/OpenGL)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Input (GLFW)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Audio (OpenAL)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Network (Netty)

Modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game (game-specific systems)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Debug (imGUI integration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Config (configuration management)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Events (event bus system)
```

### Design Principles

#### Component Design
- Pure data containers
- No behavior in components
- Flat component hierarchy
- Composition over inheritance

#### System Design
- Single responsibility per system
- Event-based communication
- Configurable behavior
- Easy enable/disable support

#### Core Principles
- Modularity First: Systems should be easily swappable
- Simple but Extensible: Core systems provide basic functionality with clear extension points
- Data-Oriented: Focus on data transformation rather than object behavior
- Event-Driven: Loose coupling through event-based communication

### Development Guidelines

The project follows these key principles:

- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Composition over Inheritance
- Data-Oriented Design
- Event-Driven Architecture
